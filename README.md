> Note: This code is built against the code version of PWAKit v2.7.3 released on June 20th 2023 for Node 18: https://github.com/SalesforceCommerceCloud/pwa-kit/releases/tag/v2.7.3

If you are using an earlier version, please consider upgrading your codebase to match this for Node 18 support.

## Known Limitations

### Localisation
By default we point to the same SFCC instance as the vanilla Retail React app. If you are pointing to your own SFCC sandbox, you should ensure that you have localisation enabled. See guide at [Localization README.md](./app/translations/README.md), [Overview](./docs/amplience/getting-started.md) and  [Salesforce Commerce Cloud Setup](./docs/amplience/sfcc-setup.md).

### Customer Groups API & Content Personalisation
There is currently no 'out of the box' API available that enables you to see which customer groups a user is associated to for Content Personalisation. To enable Content Personalisation on your own sandbox, please follow the steps to install our cartridge which enables a hook to get the required information via OCAPI.

Please ensure that your SFCC sandbox has the [Amplience Hooks Bridge Cartridge](https://github.com/amplience/amplience-sfcc-hooksbridge) installed with the correct OCAPI permissions as per the documentation.

> Note: When the Salesforce [Shopper Context API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/commerce-api/references/shopper-context) is out of BETA, the code examples may change to make use of this API.

# The Retail React App

The Retail React App is a project template that includes an isomorphic JavaScript storefront and [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) built using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Express](https://expressjs.com/). It uses a modern headless architecture that enables developers to decouple front-end code from back-end systems. It leverages popular open-source libraries in the React ecosystem, such as [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) components, [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) (CSS-in-JS), [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/), and many more.

Developers don’t have to worry about the underlying infrastructure, whether they’re developing their app locally, deploying it to a [Managed Runtime](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/mrt-overview.html) environment, or testing the app live.

## Requirements

-   Node 18.x
-   npm 9.x

## Get Started

To start your web server for local development, run the following command in your project directory:

```bash
npm start
```

Now that the development server is running, you can open a browser and preview your commerce app and go to http://localhost:3000.

## Localization

See the [Localization README.md](./app/translations/README.md) for important setup instructions for localization.

## Configuration Files

The Retail React App's configuration files are located in the `app/config` folder. For more details, see [Configuration Files](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/configuration-options.html) in the documentation.

## Documentation

The full documentation for PWA Kit and Managed Runtime is hosted on the [Salesforce Developers](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/overview) portal.

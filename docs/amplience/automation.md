# Automation

In order to save manual entry to use this starting point we have included an automation directory with all the relevant content and media

##Media

Take the media from `amplience/media` and upload to your Amplience Content Hub and publish.

## Content import

Install the Amplience Dynamic Content CLI as can be found [here](https://github.com/amplience/dc-cli)

Configure the CLI to point to your account (you will need your Amplience hub ID, clientID and clientSecret)

You will need the following information from your Ampliene account:
* Amplience Hub ID
* API details: Note the [Amplience Account](amplience-account.md) specifics which require admin and DAM-API access.
    * API Client ID
    * API Client Secret
* Repository IDs: which you can get from [here](https://amplience.com/docs/intro/repositorysettings.html)
    * Content
    * Clots

Run the following command replacing the variables with details from your Amplience account:

```
npm run import \
    --- --hubId <hubId> \
    --clientId <clientId> \
    --clientSecret <clientSecret> \
    --contentRepoId <contentRepoId> \
    --slotsRepoId <slotsRepoId>
```

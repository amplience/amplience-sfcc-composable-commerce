# Automation

In order to save manual entry to use this starting point we have included an automation directory with all the relevant content and media

> Note: you will need dc-cli version v0.17.1+ for automation to work properly but we would recommend running latest (v0.19.0 at time of writing)

## Media

Take the media from `amplience/media` and upload to your [Amplience Media Hub](https://ondemand.amplience.com) and publish.

For any videos uploaded, you will need to assign [Video Transcoding Profiles](https://amplience.com/developers/docs/user-guides/assets/video/). 240p, 480p & 720p profiles are enabled on your account by default. Simply add the profiles to the video and once completed publish the video.

> WARNING! If this is not done before importing content, you'll get errors when running the application

## Content import

Install the Amplience Dynamic Content CLI as can be found [here](https://github.com/amplience/dc-cli)

Configure the CLI to point to your account (you will need your Amplience hubId, clientId and clientSecret)

You will need the following information from your Amplience and SFCC account:

* Amplience Hub ID
* API details: Note the [Amplience Account](amplience-account.md) specifics which require admin and DAM-API access.
    * API Client ID
    * API Client Secret
* Repository IDs: which you can get from [here](https://amplience.com/docs/intro/repositorysettings.html)
    * Content
    * Slots
    * Site Components
* Mapping file path: optional file path to write mapping file, default `.amplience/imports/sfcc-<hubId>.json`
* Temporary directory path: optional temporary directory for all run files, default `amplience-sfcc/amplience-sfcc-${nanoid()}`
* SFCC credentials to create Product selector extension:
    * SFCC url
    * SFCC version
    * Auth URL
    * Auth client ID
    * Auth secret
    * Site ID

By default, the automation will use the [Amplience Credit Service](https://amplience.com/developers/docs/ai-services/credits) for creating Generative Content with the Rich Text component so there is no need to use the `--openaiKey` parameter.
There is an optional command to specify your own OpenAI key for use with the Rich Text component for Generative Content `--openaiKey`.


[Documentation](https://github.com/amplience/dc-extension-rich-text)

If this is not present, then no API key will be set but you can still use the Rich Text component without the AI assistant.

Run the following command replacing the variables with details from your Amplience account:

```
npm run import \
    --- --hubId <hubId> \
    --clientId <clientId> \
    --clientSecret <clientSecret> \
    --contentRepoId <contentRepoId> \
    --slotsRepoId <slotsRepoId> \
    --sitestructureRepoId <sitestructureRepoId> \
    --mapFile <mapFile> \
    --tempDir <tempDir> \
    --sfccUrl <sfccUrl> \
    --sfccVersion <sfccVersion> \
    --authClientId <authClientId> \
    --authSecret <authSecret> \
    --authUrl <authUrl> \
    --siteId <siteId> \
    --openaiKey <openaiKey>
```

## Hub Clean

The script run will clean out the hub, delete or archive next items:
 - content type schemas
 - content types
 - content items and slots
 - folders
 - events and editions
 - webhooks
 - extensions
 - settings
 - default `.amplience/imports/sfcc-<hubId>.json` or specified mapFile

You will need the following information from your Amplience account:
* Amplience Hub ID
* API details: Note the [Amplience Account](amplience-account.md) specifics which require admin and DAM-API access.
  * API Client ID
  * API Client Secret
* mapFile path, if custom one was used during import (optional)

```
npm run clean \
    -- --hubId <hubId> \
    --clientId <clientId> \
    --clientSecret <clientSecret> \
    --mapFile <mapFilePath> 
```

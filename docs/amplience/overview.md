## Github

A version already Amplience enabled can be found [here](https://github.com/amplience/amplience-sfcc-composable-commerce ): 

This contains the app code and also automation to populate an Amplience account.

## Localization enablement

Please note, the default SFCC business manager account does not have locales enabled. Please refer to the documentation on Salesforce for further information.

To enable localization in PWA Kit there are 3 steps:

1. configure locales on your SFCC sandbox: [Salesforce Commerce Cloud Infocenter](https://documentation.b2c.commercecloud.salesforce.com/DOC2/index.jsp?topic=%2Fcom.demandware.dochelp%2Fcontent%2Fb2c_commerce%2Ftopics%2Fadmin%2Fb2c_configuring_site_locales.html)

2. In `config/default.js`, set url.locale to a valid value [(Configuration Files | B2C Commerce PWA Kit and Managed Runtime | Salesforce Developers)](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/configuration-options.html#url-formatting)

3. configure `config/sites.js` to support multiple locales that match the locales you setup in BM [(Multiple Sites | B2C Commerce PWA Kit and Managed Runtime | Salesforce Developers)](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/commerce/pwa-kit-managed-runtime/guide/multiple-sites.html)
